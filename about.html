Our Story<br?

Bintumani Young Stars Football Club began its journey in 2017 under the leadership of Coach Kanayo (Sadiku Sallieu Fofanah). The club’s name evolved—from Thankorosidia F.C., to Madina F.C., and then Mantenkelly F.C.. Due to a law requiring community-based organisations to avoid individual names, the club was officially renamed Bintumani Young Stars Football Club.<br>

The current name was given by our club manager and sponsor, Mantenkelly Fofanah, with full support from his wife, Marie. This dedicated couple has been the backbone of our club, providing sponsorship and unwavering support from day one.<br>
